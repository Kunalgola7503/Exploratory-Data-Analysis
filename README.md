# 🏡 House Prices EDA Project

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a house prices dataset.  
The aim is to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can be useful for understanding the factors affecting house prices.  

## 🔧 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Inspection**
   - Loaded dataset from a local CSV file.
   - Checked dimensions, datatypes, and initial data quality.

2. **Data Cleaning**
   - Handled missing values.
   - Removed/treated outliers.
   - Converted categorical variables where needed.

3. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Distribution of numerical features (histograms, boxplots).
   - Frequency of categorical features (bar plots).

4. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Correlation heatmaps between numerical features.
   - Relationship between target variable (Price) and predictors.
   - Categorical vs. numerical comparisons (boxplots, violin plots).

5. **Multivariate Analysis**
   - Pairplots to explore feature interactions.
   - Advanced visualizations to identify key influencing factors.

6. **Insights & Observations**
   - Factors such as area, number of rooms, location, etc. have significant impact.
   - Outliers in price distribution identified and analyzed.
